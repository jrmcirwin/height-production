# Summary

In this project I combine Heckman and Cunha's capacity formation model with the "thrifty phenotype" hypothesis. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis, outlined below, implies dynamic complementarity between nutrition *in-utero* and nutrition in childhood. I hope to test this implication with respect to child height using contemporary data from Indonesia.

Testing dynamic complementarity requires two instruments, one for *in-utero* nutrition and another for childhood nutrition. My first instrument would be the 1998 Indonesian economic crisis, a negative shock to nutrition for mothers and children exposed to it. My second instrument would be rainfall-by-district-by-year, which affects local incomes and food availability. My prediction, based on the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, is that the effect of improved nutrition in childhood will have a greater effect on height for children exposed to the 1998 crisis post-birth than for children exposed *in-utero*. Such a result would suggest that nutrition is relatively more substitutable across periods of childhood than between gestation and childhood.

# Theory

Infant growth, with sufficient nutrition, follows a well-defined trajectory. Malnutrition causes departure from a given trajectory, slowing the velocity of growth. Following malnutrition, increased nutrition may result in accelerated growth. This is known as "catch-up" growth, as the child reaches a higher growth curve, closer to their biological potential. The biological potential has a genetic component, but also is likely to have an epigenetic component. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis suggests that poor nutrition *in-utero* will result in a phenotype of a slower metabolism and less growth in height. Such a child will then be better suited for an environment with low nutrient availability.

Although epigenetic switches are not yet well understood, they are, for the most part, determined *in-utero*.[^1] Thus, gestation offers a unique period of programming, in which the child's potential growth path is determined. To what degree this potential is reached is determined by net-nutrition during. While oversimplified, this narrative can be easily represented within the capability-production framework, as dynamic complementarity of nutritional inputs between gestation and childhood.

Rephrased in the model of Heckman and Cunha, we have:

$$ h = A[\gamma I_1^\theta +(1-\gamma)(I_2)^\theta]^{\frac{1}{\theta}}
$$

where $h$ is the adult height of an individual, $I_1$ is nutrition in the pre-natal period and $I_2$ is nutrition post-birth. The hypothesis that nutrition *in-utero*is a complement to nutrition in childhood can be stated as a condition on the cross derivative:
$$\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial I_1\partial (I_2+I_3)} > 0
$$

# Estimation

In order to estimate the cross derivative, we need a quasi-random shock to in-utero nutrition, and a quasi-random shock to childhood nutrition. In simple terms, the thrifty phenotype, or dynamic complementarity in height production, implies that the effect of childhood nutrition on height is greater for those who had better in-utero nutrition. My setting is Indonesia from 1998-2007. My instrument for *in-utero* nutrition is the 1998 economic crisis in Indonesia, which saw incomes fall and prices rise, leading to widespread deterioration in nutrition. My instrument for nutrition in childhood is rainfall, which leads affects local incomes and food availability across Indonesia.

The research process would take three steps:

1. Determine the effect of the 1998 crisis on those *in-utero* at the time, using data collected in 2000.[^2]
2. Determine the effect of rainfall on child height, using data collected in 2007.
3. If both of these effects are as expected, then run an interaction of the two, where I estimate the effect of rainfall on child height depending on whether the child was exposed to the 1998 crisis *in-utero*.

The 1998 shock affected the entire population. I assume that the rising prices translated into worse nutrition for children and mothers. Thus, there is a cohort who was exposed to the 1998 shock *in-utero* and another which was exposed as a neonate. Otherwise than the timing of their birth, which is separated by a few months, these groups should be broadly similar. Post-1998, differential rainfall across Indonesia yields a second instrument for nutrition, as increased rainfall causes greater local incomes and food availability. Thus we have instruments for *in-utero* nutrition and for childhood nutrition. The effect of rainfall on child height should be positive, the effect of exposure to the 1998 shock *in-utero* negative, and the interaction term between the two negative.

## Parental Investments

One concern would be that parents compensate or reinforce the nutritional shocks. Parents base their investments on birth endowments, meaning that my results could not be interpreted as purely biological. One way to test for parental responses would be to compare the heights of children with a sibling exposed to the 1998 crisis *in-utero* to those with a sibling exposed to the 1998 crisis as a neonate. If parental investments respond to birth endowments, then we ought to see changes in the height of children who have exposed siblings
