There has been some debate over whether there are dynamic complementarities in the production of human capital. While the production function approach introduced by Heckman enables a rich framework within-which to explore human capital "production," it steers the conversation away from tangible discussion of what human capital actually is. It seems obvious that some traits which have been described as human capital would exhibit dynamic complementarities. Providing Othello to a high-school student will undoubtedly be more useful for those of greater reading advancement. Conversely, many elements of education exhibit dynamic substitutabilities. Courses on reading are not useful for those who learned to read before coming to school. Clearly the style of education can be rememdial or push children on. These two investments would have different degrees of dynamic complementarity vs substitutability. Which of these extremes characterizes "human capital" _in general_ is perhaps an ill-posed question, given that human capital encompasses many dimensions of differing importance depending on the social setting. 

In this project, I try to identify one, biological dimension of HK, and estimate the degree of dynamic complementarity of production. By taking a smaller goal as a starting point, I hope to be able to address a tangible question. The dimension of human capital which I will explore is height. The investments in the output is net nutrition. I will attempt to take the simplest model possible, exploring nutrition in 2 periods: pre-natal and post-natal. I will then try to estimate the elasticity of height response to nutritional inputs. There is substantial work in physiology describing the underlying processes of growth, which I hope to use to have _a-priori_ predictions and assumption. The next section will outline these assumptions.

The velocity of growth in an infant typically follows well-define curves. Nutrient deprivation will result in falling off such a curve. Continuous malnutrition would result in being on a generally lower curve. If lack of growth is due to nutritional deprivation, then "catch-up growth," where the child grows at a rapid rate until it reaches a new stable growth path, may occur. Thus, post-birth the child's body takes the nutritional environment as the constraint to following a natural biological potential. 

Hypothesis: the *in-utero* environment affects the biological growth potential for the child. This is a natural corollary of the "thrifty phenotype" hypothesis. Pre-natal stress will trigger epigenetic changes which reduce the basal metabolic rate and growth path of the child. Rather than producing "productive assets" like height, the body will take extra nutrition to create "buffer assets", increasing adiposity. Formulated in terms of child height growth with respect to pre-and-post-natal nutrition, we have that the cross-derivative is positive. For the same nutritional shock in the post-natal period, the height response will be greater for those who had better *in-utero* nutrition.

Rephrased in the model of Heckman and Cunha, we have:
$$ h = A[\gamma I_1^\theta + (1-\gamma)I_2^\theta]^{\frac{1}{\theta}}
$$

where $h$ is the adult height of an individual, $I_1$ is nutrition in the pre-natal period and $I_2$ is nutrition in the post-natal period.[^1] The hypothesis which I have stated above is equivalent in this framework to the cross-derivative of the inputs:
$$\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial I_1\partial I_2} > 0
$$

i.e. the thrifty-phenotype hypothesis is an example of dynamic complementarity across two developmental stages. The sign of the cross-derivative is determined by whether $1 > \theta$.

# Contribution

Thus far the thrifty phenotype has been given mostly as a reason for chronic conditions. However, it would also explain differing productivity based on maternal nutrition. To my knowledge I am the first to map the two interallated concepts. In hindsight, it is obvious that the thrifty phenotype is an example of dynamic complementarity. Much is made obvious when we clarify our concepts, rather than using muddy terms like "human capital."

The thrifty phenotype encompasses dynamic complementarity of height production, but not vice versa. The thrifty phenotype is much larger than this one aspect. Thus even if we do not find dynamic complementarity, we can't throw out the thrifty phenotype, rather we would find no evidence of this additional feature. Still, the notion of height response is conceptually appealing given the evolutionary argument for the thrifty phenotype (phenotypic plasticity in the face of changing environment).

# Estimation

In order to estimate the cross derivative, we need two shocks. Given a population, we need a quasi-random shock to in-utero nutrition, and then a quasi-random shock to childhood nutrition. In simple terms, the thrifty phenotype, or dynamic complementarity in height production, implies that the effect of childhood nutrition on height is greater for those who had better in-utero nutrition.

## Example Strategy

The 1998 Indonesian crisis can give us variation in *in-utero* health relative to infant health. The cohort born in January 1998 did not experience the crisis *in-utero*. The cohort born in October experienced it fully. Here I draw from my methodology of my MA thesis. The exposed cohort has a relatively worse *in-utero* period, while the unexposed group has a worse early childhood experience. My hypothesis is that nutrition between early and middle/late childhood is more substitutable than between childhood and gestation. As the exogenous variation in childhood nutrition, I would use cross-sectional variation in rainfall. Conceptually the comparison groups are: (1) a child born in January 1998 in a wet district, (2) a child born in October 1998 in a wet district, (3) a child born in January 1998 in a dry district, and (4) a child born in October 1998 in a dry district. As the children born in October were exposed to an adverse *in-utero* shock, their height will be less responsive to nutritional inputs[^2], implying that 
$$h_1 - h_3 > h_2 - h_4$$.

I would observe hemoglobin in 2000, allowing me to quantify the effect of the 1998 shock on fetal health. Then I would observe height in 2007. This is a period of linear growth, and there should be good substitutability of nutrition across the period. Thus, we can sum the rainfall by district in order to assign a measure of rainfall.

The research process would take three steps:

1. Check that the 1998 shock affects *in-utero* nutrition.
2. Check that rainfall from 1998-2007 affects child height
3. Interact these two effects

The 1998 shock affected the entire population. I assume that the rising prices translated into worse nutrition for children and mothers. Thus, there is a cohort who was exposed to the 1998 shock *in-utero* and another which was exposed in *infanthood*. Otherwise these groups are comparable, as the financial crisis was unforeseen. Post-1998, differential rainfall across Indonesia yields a second instrument for nutrition investments, as increased rainfall is associated with greater local production of food as well as lower local food prices. Thus we have an instrument for *in-utero* nutrition and for childhood nutrition. Given the thrifty-phenotype hypothesis, we would expect that the within childhood investments are more substitutable than investments between childhood and gestation. Conceptually, we expect those with a better *in-utero* experience and worse early childhood experience to have a greater height response to positive nutrition shocks later in childhood.

## Parental Investments

One concern would be that parents compensate or reinforce the nutritional shocks. Reinforcing or compensating for the *in-utero* shock is not a big deal as long as the compensation is less that total. However, if parents reinforce or compensate on the childhood shock *depending on the stock of height determined by in-utero health* then I might have a problem. I could not then distinguish between the biological and behavioral response. One thing I could do would be to focus on a shock which is less mediated via household dynamics than others. Maybe a universal program like school lunches?

One way to test for this response would be to compare the heights of children with a sibling born in Jan 1998 with those with a sibling born in Oct 1998. If parents are reinforcing investments then those with exposed siblings should have greater height.

[^1]: While more flexible than previous research, which had considered only the average nutrition, this specification is still *extremely* restrictive. Still, we must balance realism with tractability.

[^2]: They might also be more resilient. This would mean that the mortality response to environmental changes would be smaller for the October cohort.
